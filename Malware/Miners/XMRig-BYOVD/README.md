## Summary

A sophisticated cryptojacking campaign distributed customized XMRig miners through pirated software bundles (office productivity suites). The campaign combined **BYOVD** (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) exploitation with a **time-based logic bomb** and **USB worm propagation** to create a resilient, high-performance mining botnet. The vulnerable driver `WinRing0x64.sys` (CVE-2020-14979) enabled kernel-level CPU control, boosting RandomX hashrate by **15–50%**. A hardcoded deadline of December 23, 2025 triggered automatic self-destruction via the `barusu` command.

## Attack Chain

```
Pirated Software Download (social engineering)
└── Malware Dropper (multi-function executable)
    ├── [No param] → Environment validation, initial install
    ├── [002 Re:0] → Deploy payloads, launch miner, monitoring loop
    ├── [016]      → Restart miner if terminated (watchdog)
    └── [barusu]   → Self-destruct: kill all, delete files
        │
        ├── Logic Bomb Check (system time)
        │   ├── Before 2025-12-23 → Install persistence + launch miner
        │   └── After 2025-12-23  → Execute barusu (auto-decommission)
        │
        ├── BYOVD: WinRing0x64.sys (CVE-2020-14979)
        │   └── Kernel-level CPU config → +15-50% RandomX hashrate
        │
        ├── DLL Sideloading
        │   └── Legitimate Windows Telemetry service → sideload miner DLL
        │
        ├── Persistence Modules
        │   └── Registry keys, scheduled tasks, service installation
        │
        └── USB Worm Propagation
            └── Removable media → lateral movement (air-gapped environments)
```

## Dropper Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Action |
|----------|--------|
| _(none)_ | Environment validation, migration during initial install |
| `002 Re:0` | Deploy payloads, launch miner, enter monitoring loop |
| `016` | Restart miner process if terminated (watchdog) |
| `barusu` | Self-destruct: terminate all components, delete files |

## Key Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **BYOVD** | Vulnerable `WinRing0x64.sys` driver (CVE-2020-14979) for privilege escalation |
| **Logic Bomb** | Hardcoded date check (2025-12-23): operate before, self-destruct after |
| **DLL Sideloading** | Legitimate Windows Telemetry service used to load miner DLL |
| **USB Worm** | Propagation via removable media, reaches air-gapped systems |
| **Modular Design** | Single executable acts as installer, watchdog, payload manager, cleaner |
| **RandomX Boost** | Kernel-level CPU tuning via vulnerable driver: +15–50% hashrate |

The same report also documents a parallel campaign:
- **Toolkit:** ILOVEPOOP
- **Vulnerability:** React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)
- **Method:** AI/LLM-generated exploit framework → Python toolkit → XMRig miner
- **Scale:** 90+ hosts compromised in a single session
- **Targets:** Government, defense, finance, industrial organizations (US)
- **Note:** Demonstrates AI-assisted cybercrime lowering the barrier to entry
