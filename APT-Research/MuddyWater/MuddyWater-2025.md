## Threat Actor Write-up

MuddyWater, also known by aliases such as TA450 and Seedworm, is a sophisticated threat actor group active since at least 2017. Analysts believe the group is state-sponsored and operates in support of Iranian government interests. The group’s primary motivations are espionage and intelligence collection. MuddyWater targets a range of sectors including government, telecommunications, energy, and critical infrastructure, concentrating efforts in the Middle East, South Asia, and NATO-affiliated countries. The group is capable of both long-term information collection and, when aligned with geopolitical objectives, disruptive or destructive operations.

## Modus Operandi

MuddyWater primarily relies on phishing and spear-phishing to gain initial access to organizations and persons of interest. After achieving initial footholds, they use remote monitoring and management tools, custom and third-party malware, and lateral movement techniques to establish and maintain long-term stealthy access. While maintaining persistence, they conduct intelligence collection, internal reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and prepare for follow-on actions tailored to the target. The group has also executed destructive operations during periods of geopolitical conflict as a tactical measure aligned with state objectives.
