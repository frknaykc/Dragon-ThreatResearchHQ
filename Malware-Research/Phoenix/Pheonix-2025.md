## About

The Phoenix malware is used by MuddyWater to deploy what Group-IB assesses to be a new, minimalistic variant of the BugSleep backdoor by self-injecting the backdoor into its own process. It decrypts an embedded PE file, maps it into its process memory, and transfers execution to its entry point.

Two versions of the backdoor have been observed in the wild; both are associated with MuddyWater and are distinguishable from PDB paths.

## Phoenix — Version 3

- The backdoor begins by copying itself to a new location using PowerShell commands (for example: `powershell.exe -Command "Copy-Item -Path %malware path% -Destination 'C:\ProgramData\Logs' -Force"`).  
- It then generates a machine GUID by concatenating the username and computer name — similar to the technique used by the BugSleep backdoor.  
- Next, it registers with the C2 server via the `/register` endpoint.  
- After registration, it enters a C2 communication loop where it periodically sends an `/iamalive` beacon to the C2 and retrieves commands from the `/request` endpoint.

## Phoenix — Version 4

This version exhibits the following behavior:

- Attempts to create a mutex named `sysprocupdate.exe`.  
- Gathers system information, including computer name, domain/workgroup, Windows version, and username.  
- Copies itself to `C:\ProgramData\sysprocupdate.exe`.  
- Establishes persistence by modifying the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` under the `Shell` value.  
- Connects to its C2 server via WinHTTP to receive and execute commands.
